How to Run?
The users should use IDE such as ItelliJ or Eclipse to open the whole "Zhuoran_Bi-20217231" folder, then users can easily run this program by run the Main.java which is in the src package. (if you open Main.java only, but not the complete folder, the program may not be able to run.)

My structure:
I write a class diagram to show the structure of my Java program. It can be seen at the same folder as this readme file which name is ClassDiagram.png.
